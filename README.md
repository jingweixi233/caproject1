The project is about pipelined Y86 processor.

The project is organized into three parts, each with its own handin. 

In Part A you will write some simple Y86 programs and become familiar with the Y86 tools. 

In Part B, you will extend the SEQ simulator with two new instructions. These two parts will prepare you for Part C, the heart of the lab.

In part C, you will optimize the Y86 benchmark program and the processor design.
